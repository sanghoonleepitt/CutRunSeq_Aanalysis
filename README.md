Raw fastq.gz file download was done and md5sum measurement was done. You can check "MD5Summary_TFAP2bHCC2185_CutRun_Abdalla.txt" file in the folder.

2.  HCC2185 2 AP2B antibody repeat 2
3.  HCC2185 3 AP2B antibody repeat 3
4.  HCC2185 1 IgG antibody repeat 1
5.  HCC2185 2 IgG antibody repeat 2
6.  HCC2185 3 IgG antibody repeat 3

8.  BCK4 2 AP2B antibody repeat 2
9.  BCK4 3 AP2B antibody repeat 3
10. BCK4 1 IgG antibody repeat 1
11. BCK4 2 IgG antibody repeat 2\
    ~~12. BCK4 3 IgG antibody repeat 3~~ \# missing
12. BCK4 3 H3K4ME3 (for positive control)

## Step1. Measure md5sum for the downloaded files.

md5sum is used to verify the integrity of files, as virtually any change to a file will cause its MD5 hash to change. Most commonly, md5sum is used to verify that a file has not changed as a result of a faulty file transfer, a disk error or non-malicious meddling.

-   **Step1_Readmd5Summary_MeasureFilemd5sum.R**

You can use this R code or write your own code. After running this code, you will get "MD5Summary_TFAP2bCutRun_Abdalla.txt" output file which summarizes the md5sum measurement and comparison with the md5sum values given by the sequencing core. The output file is already stored at */bgfs/alee/LO_LAB/General/Lab_Data/20231012_LeeCHP5_Abdalla_M134M453_CutRunSeq*

## Step2. Trimming

Trimmomatic is a flexible read trimming tool for Illumina NGS data

Two files you need

-   **Step1_FindFastqFile_RunSlurm_Trimmomatic.pl**
-   **Slurm_Step1_trimmomaticV0.39_CRC.sl**

This perl code is to run for loop for each sample fastq files and submit slurm job for Trimmomatic This slurm script is to submit Trimmomatic job. You will get trimmed .fastq.gz files at `../04_TrimmomaticOut_CutRun_4smp`

<!-- ![Figure 2. Aligned .bam file from the trimmed .fastq.gz files for Sample 1](Fig2_TrimmedFastqgzFile.png) -->
![Figure 2. Aligned .bam file from the trimmed .fastq.gz files for Sample 1](https://github.com/leeoesterreich/CutAndRunSeqAnalysis/assets/87338488/8cb41012-6dbb-4c0a-85fa-ac086b953f5a)

## Step3. Bowtie alignment to a reference genome

Trimmomatic is a flexible read trimming tool for Illumina NGS data

Two files you need

-   **Step3_Perl_ReadTrimmomaticFASTQ_Alignment.pl**
-   **Slurm_Step3_Integrated_Bowtie_SHmodified.sl**

This perl code is to run for loop for each sample trimmed fastq files and submit slurm job for Bowtie alignment. Before running Bowtie alignment, you should prefare reference genome in advance. NDA-Mb-134 is human cell line. You need to download human reference genome fasta files fron NCBI or Gencode. I recommend using hg39. Then, you need to make bowtie index files and set the directory of reference genome in your slurm script.

The alignment will be stored at an output directory you directed in your perl code, for example, `../05_CutRunTools_Output_4smp/OESTERREICH_1_S1/aligned.aug10/`

<!-- ![Figure 3. Aligned .bam file from the trimmed .fastq.gz files for Sample 1](Fig3_AlignedBamFile.png) -->
![Figure 3. Aligned .bam file from the trimmed .fastq.gz files for Sample 1](https://github.com/leeoesterreich/CutAndRunSeqAnalysis/assets/87338488/a6ec6703-a846-4298-b052-7a387bd18ee9)

## Step4. Samtools for sorting and duplicate marking for your .bam file.

Samtools allows you to manipulate the .bam files - they can be converted into a non-binary format (SAM format specification here) and can also be ordered and sorted based on the quality of the alignment. Duplicate reads lead to an over-representation of sequence data at the location of those reads. Duplicate marking indicates that the duplicate reads should not be used for analysis. As an alternative, duplicates can be removed.

Two files you need

-   **Step4_Perl_ReadBAM_SortDupMarkingBam.pl**
-   **Slurm_Step4_integrated_SortDupMarkingBam.sl**

When you finish this step, you will get multiple output folders and each folder has sorted or duplicate marking .bam files + bam index (.bai) files. For example, you will get a duplicate-deleted .bam file at `../05_CutRunTools_Output_4smp/OESTERREICH_1_S1/aligned.aug10/dedup/`

<!-- ![Figure 4. Sorted and duplicate read deleted .bam files](Fig4_SortedDupMarkedBAM.png) -->
![Figure 4. Sorted and duplicate read deleted .bam files](https://github.com/leeoesterreich/CutAndRunSeqAnalysis/assets/87338488/10ee9a46-af8d-4176-a52e-6cdc3f6071eb)

Figure 4. Sorted and duplicate read deleted .bam files

## Step5. Convert .bam files to .bedgraph files.

BedGraph is a file format that allows display of continuous-valued data in a track in genome browsers that support the format. "bedtools genomecov" computes histograms (default), per-base reports (-d) and BEDGRAPH (-bg) summaries of feature coverage (e.g., aligned sequences) for a given genome.

Two files you need

-   **Step5_Perl_ReadBAM_ConvertToBedgraphDirectly_Bedtools.pl**
-   **Slurm_Step5_bedtools_Bam2BedgraphDirectly.sl**

In the Perl file, you can direct output directory. For example, I directed "/bgfs/alee/LO_LAB/Personal/SanghoonLee/H46c_CutRunPeakcallingInstruction/*06_SEACR_v1.3/01a_BedgraphOutput_dupdeleted*" as an output directory. My Perl will make the directories, `"/06_SEACR_v1.3"` and `"/06_SEACR_v1.3/01a_BedgraphOutput_dupdeleted"`, automatically. When you finish this step, you will get .bedgraph output files at the output directory you directed.

<!-- ![Figure 5. .bedgraph files from .bam files](Fig5_Bam2BedGraph.png) -->
![Figure 5. .bedgraph files from .bam files](https://github.com/leeoesterreich/CutAndRunSeqAnalysis/assets/87338488/e7b2102e-5231-4936-aa61-d7e48b641f64)

Figure 5. .bedgraph files from .bam files

## Step6. Run *S*parse *E*nrichment *A*nalysis for *C*UT&*R*UN (SEACR) to get peaking calling .bed files.

SEACR is intended to call peaks and enriched regions from sparse CUT&RUN or chromatin profiling data in which background is dominated by "zeroes" (i.e. regions with no read coverage). `.bedgraph` files are SEACR's input files. SEACR will generate peak calling output files, which are .bed format. SEACR requires R and Bedtools. If you open the slurm script, you can see it loads R and Bedtools.

Two files you need

-   **Step6_Perl_ReadBedgraph_RunSEACR.pl**
-   **Slurm_Step6_SEACR_bedgraph2bed.sl**

[Be careful.]{style="color:red;"} SEACR requires two input files; one is experimental Cut&Run-seq sample's bedgraph file; the other is *negative control* Cut&Run-seq sample's .bedgraph file. As you see the Perl code line 12 and 13, you should assign two .bedgraph files.

> my \$BedgraphFile = \$BedgraphPath."/OESTERREICH_1.fragments.bedgraph";

\# first input file is a bedgraph file of experimental sample in Cut&Run-seq

> my \$BackgroundSmp = \$BedgraphPath="/OESTERREICH_4.fragments.bedgraph";

\# second input file is a bedgraph file of negative control in Cut&Run-seq

In the slurm script, **"Slurm_Step6_SEACR_bedgraph2bed.sl"**, it requires ["SEACR_1.3.sh"]{style="color:red;"} This file is stored at Github too. By the way, this .shell file requires "SEACR_1.3.R" file. This file is also stored at Github too.

In the Perl file, you can direct output directory. For example, I directed "/bgfs/alee/LO_LAB/Personal/SanghoonLee/H46b_CutRun_HCC2185_TFAP2b_Abdalla/06_SEACR_v1.3/*02a_SEACROutput_dupdeleted*" as an output directory. My Perl will make the directories, `"/02a_SEACROutput_dupdeleted"`, automatically. When you finish this step, you will get *.bed* output files at the output directory you directed.

<!--  ![Figure 6. SEACR peak calling to get .bed files from .bedgraph](Fig6_SEACROut_BedFile.png)  -->
![Figure 6. SEACR peak calling to get .bed files from .bedgraph](https://github.com/leeoesterreich/CutAndRunSeqAnalysis/assets/87338488/97b3e3f3-e73d-4d2b-9566-70e294481822)

Figure 6. SEACR peak calling to get .bed files from .bedgraph

## Step7. Convert SEACR .bed =\> .bedgraph =\> Sort .bedgraph =\> convert the sorted.bedgraph to .bigwig file.

The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is a high-performance, easy-to-use, interactive tool for the visual exploration of genomic data. It requires .bigwig file as an input file. More detailed explanation of Stpe7 is written in **"Step7_README_Bed2Bedgraph_Bedgraph2BigWig.txt"**

Two files you need

-   **Step7_Perl_BedgraphToBigWig_ReadBedgraphSort_MakeBigWig.pl**
-   **Slurm_Step7_BedgraphSortToBigWig.sl**

Once you direct the folder that has SEACR .bed files, the slurm script will 1) conver .bed to .bedgraph, 2) sort the .bedgraph, and 3) convert .bedgraph to .bigwig file. This .bigwig file is used as an input file for IGV.

<!-- ![Figure 7. Making .bigwig file from SEACR output](Fig7_MakeBigWigFromSEACRout.png)  -->
